# Documentation

PocketDex keeps the public docs small and practical.

Use this index based on what you need:

- root [`README.md`](../README.md): end-user onboarding flow (server -> desktop/web/mobile) and Tailscale setup
- `development.md`: local setup, run, and debug workflow
- `architecture.md`: high-level component map
- `codex_desktop_live_sync.md`: implemented desktop live sync behavior
- `codex_desktop_sync_investigation.md`: deep investigation notes and findings
